## ⚙️ Technical Description

This platform combines **Legal BERT** and **GPT-4o** in a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow:

- Extracts clauses and important sections
- Provides citation-backed answers to questions
- Drafts summaries efficiently
- Integrates with document management systems (DMS) securely
- Reduces research time by up to **87%**

---

## 🔍 Problem Solved

Manual document review and knowledge retrieval are:

- Slow and error-prone
- Expensive in highly regulated domains
- Risky due to missed clauses or outdated references

Teams often spend hours searching PDFs and cross-referencing precedents.
