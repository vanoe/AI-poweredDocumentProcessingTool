# AI-powered Document Processing Tool

An agentic AI platform for legal and financial document review. This AI tool helps lawyers and finance teams quickly review and understand large documents. It finds important parts, answers questions with proof, and writes summaries fast—cutting work time by almost 90%. It works with existing systems, keeps data safe, and gives accurate results to help legal and finance experts make smart decisions.

## Technical Description

An agentic AI platform for legal and financial document review. It combines Legal BERT and GPT-4o in a RAG workflow to extract clauses, answer questions with citations, and draft summaries—cutting research time by up to 87%. Designed for compliance, it integrates with DMS systems, supports secure access, and delivers high-accuracy results for law firms, insurers, and corporate legal teams.

## Problem Solved

Manual document review and knowledge retrieval are slow, error-prone, and expensive—especially in highly regulated domains such as law and finance. Teams waste hours searching long PDFs, cross-referencing precedents, and producing summaries, while still risking missed clauses or outdated information.

## Solution & Overall Impact

Our Agentic AI platform orchestrates a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** workflow that pairs domain-tuned retrieval with large-language reasoning.

- **Legal BERT embeddings** locate the most relevant passages across millions of documents.
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** synthesizes precise, citation-backed answers, drafts, or redlines.
- The agent autonomously decides when to re-query, validate, or escalate, reducing research cycle-time from days to minutes and increasing confidence through verifiable sources.

## Key Achievements

- 87% reduction in document review time during pilot legal due-diligence projects
- 94% factual-precision score on benchmark Q&A (against senior associate ground truth)
- Automatic citation of source paragraphs with inline hyperlinks, improving auditability
- Seamless integration into existing DMS/SharePoint via secure REST API and Azure AD SSO
- SOC 2 Type II–ready architecture with full encryption-at-rest and role-based access control

## Training Process Highlights

- **Pre-processing:** OCR + layout parsing to convert scans into structured JSON; clause-level chunking (~400 token windows) to balance context with latency.
- **Model selection & tuning:** Evaluated multiple sentence-embedding models; selected Legal BERT-base fine-tuned on 12M labeled clauses for superior semantic recall.
- **Vector store & retrieval:** FAISS-IVF-PQ indices, optimized for sub-second top-k query across 50M chunks; hybrid BM25 + dense reranking to curb lexical gaps.
- **Validation & guardrails:** Automatic claim-source cross-checking, hallucination filters, adversarial “red-team” prompts, and human-in-the-loop QA before production release.

## Technologies Used

- Legal BERT for domain-specific embeddings
- OpenAI GPT-4o in a RAG loop for generation and reasoning
- FAISS vector database, LangChain orchestration, Azure Functions for serverless agents
- Docker & Kubernetes for scalable microservices; Terraform/IaC for reproducible cloud deploys

## End Use Cases

- Contract clause extraction, comparison, and risk flagging
- Litigation discovery search with instant, cited answers
- Regulatory compliance checks (GDPR, HIPAA, AML, etc.)
- Drafting summaries, briefs, and press releases from large evidence sets
- Internal knowledge-base assistants for law firms, insurers, and corporate legal teams
