## 🔍 Problem Solved

Manual document review and knowledge retrieval are:

- Slow and error-prone
- Expensive in highly regulated domains
- Risky due to missed clauses or outdated references

Teams often spend hours searching PDFs and cross-referencing precedents.

---

## 💡 Solution & Impact

The **Agentic AI platform** orchestrates a RAG workflow:

- **Legal BERT embeddings:** Find the most relevant passages across millions of documents
- **OpenAI GPT-4o:** Generate precise, citation-backed summaries or drafts
- **Autonomous agent:** Decides when to re-query, validate, or escalate
- **Outcome:** Research cycle-time drops from days to minutes with verifiable results

---

## 🏆 Key Achievements

- ✅ 87% reduction in document review time during pilot projects
- ✅ 94% factual-precision score on benchmark Q&A
- ✅ Automatic citation of source paragraphs with inline hyperlinks
- ✅ Integration with DMS/SharePoint via REST API & Azure AD SSO
- ✅ SOC 2 Type II–ready with encryption-at-rest & role-based access control

---

## 🧠 Training Process Highlights

- **Pre-processing:** OCR + layout parsing; clause-level chunking (~400 tokens)
- **Model selection & tuning:** Legal BERT-base fine-tuned on 12M labeled clauses
- **Vector store & retrieval:** FAISS-IVF-PQ + hybrid BM25 + dense reranking
- **Validation & guardrails:** Claim-source cross-checking, hallucination filters, human-in-the-loop QA

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Legal BERT:** Domain-specific embeddings
- **OpenAI GPT-4o:** Generation & reasoning in RAG loop
- **FAISS vector database**, LangChain orchestration, Azure Functions for serverless agents
- **Docker & Kubernetes:** Scalable microservices
